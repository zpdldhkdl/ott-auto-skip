# 🎬 OTT Auto Skip

> A Chrome extension that automatically clicks intro, recap, and next-episode buttons on your favorite OTT streaming platforms — so you can binge smarter, not harder.

---

## ✨ Overview

Tired of repeatedly clicking "Skip Intro", "Skip Recap", or "Next Episode" every single episode? **OTT Auto Skip** is a lightweight Chrome extension designed to detect and automatically dismiss those repetitive prompts on OTT (Over-The-Top) streaming services.

Whether you're binge-watching a K-drama marathon, catching up on the latest Netflix series, or powering through a Disney+ backlog, this extension has your back. It monitors the DOM for skip buttons and clicks them for you — instantly, quietly, and reliably.

## 🚀 Features

- **Netflix Intro Auto Skip** — Detects and clicks elements that match `data-uia="player-skip-intro"`.
- **Netflix Recap Auto Skip** — Detects and clicks elements that match `data-uia="player-skip-recap"`.
- **Netflix Next Episode Auto Click** — Detects and clicks elements that match `data-uia="next-episode-seamless-button"`.
- **Four Toggle Controls** — Popup provides `Master ON/OFF`, `Intro Skip`, `Recap Skip`, and `Next Episode Auto Click`.
- **Persistent Settings** — Toggle values are stored via extension storage and restored on reopen.
- **Localized UI** — Popup labels and status text are localized for English, Korean, Japanese, and Simplified Chinese.
- **Privacy First** — No external data collection or remote calls for skip behavior.

- **Chrome says manifest is invalid**
  - Re-run `npm run build` and confirm `dist/manifest.json` exists.
- **Popup does not open**
  - Verify the loaded directory is `dist/` or `release/unpacked/`, not repository root.
- **Content script does not appear on a page**
  - Reload the extension in `chrome://extensions/` and refresh the target tab.
